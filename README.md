**4/8/19: Jeez I've been busy. It's already been 1 year!**

It's been 1 year without posts. What's going on? The answer to that is: I am trying to figgure out what to do with my life, play video games, and complete high school. Also: I've been working on an even more minimalist site, this time in pure HTML/CSS/JS and without (for the most part) serverside scripting.
